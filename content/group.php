<p>NTNUI Ju Jitsu consists of different members. Most of us are NTNU students, both Norwegian and international, but the group is open for everyone. Students from other schools and people who are not studying may join as well.</p>
<p>We represent different levels of experience; some of us have trained for years, while others joined the club recently and truly start from the beginning. Our trainings are held in a good atmosphere.</p>
<p>During our trainings, you will have the possibility to learn some of the basic techniques used for self-defense, and you will get skills in how to apply a controllable amount of pain to your opponent - all this while being in a friendly and respectful environment.</p>
<p>When you have decided that you want to develop yourself as a martial artist, you start practicing and you keep practicing. At NJJ, we all help each other to develop our abilities as martial artists by constantly challenging each other and sharing what we know. We also instruct in grappling, stand-up grappling, takedowns, ground fighting and striking.</p>
<p>You start by coming to a practice (you can join our sessions for free if you're a member of NTNUI) and you keep going to the gym as often as you can. Sometimes life, work, or school will get in the way of your progress, but just keep practicing as often as you can. Remember that everything takes time.</p>
<p>We practice on Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Check out our <a href="?page=schedule">training schedule</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Join us and feel the spirit of Ju Jitsu, but beware: It is easy to get addicted - once you try, you won't stop!</p>
