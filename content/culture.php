<h2>Before you start training, there are few rules you need to get familiar with.</h2>
<p>Before you come to practice, please make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>You and your gear are clean.</b> <br>
    At least that you don't smell foul.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Your nails are short and trimmed.</b> <br>
    Don't be an "Edward Scissorhands".
  </li>
  <li> <b>Your breath doesn't smell.</b> <br>
    It should be minty fresh.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Your shorts go down to your knees.</b> <br>
    We recommend long shorts or pants.
  </li>
  <li> <b>You're wearing a top.</b> <br>
    We recommend long sleeves.
  </li>
  <li> <b>You're in a good mood.</b> <br>
    Don't whine.
  </li>
  <li> <b>You're prepared to work out and listen to the instructor.</b> <br>
    Follow the instructions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And when you are at practice, remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Don't be late to practice.</b> <br>
    If you're late to practice, you'll enjoy doing two burpees for every minute you're late.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Don't skip your burpees.</b> </li>
  <li> <b>If you need a break, take a break.</b> <br>
    You know best when it comes to your own body.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Your training partner is a partner, not an opponent.</b> <br>
    Learn together, grow together, and stay in the flow together. Your partner is key to your development, so treat them at the very best! (Don't lose a friend for a win or because you want to try a fancy technique.)
  </li>
  <li> <b>If you get angry or frustrated, take a break.</b> <br>
    We don't allow brawling or fighting. We train Ju Jitsu.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Submission is a give-and-take.</b> <br>
    We are practicing, so be strong enough to tap out once in a while.
  </li>
  <li> <b>It's better to tap too early than too late.</b> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Equipment</h2><br>
<p>At most of our trainings there is no special equipment required. However, if you want to practice Ju Jitsu for a while, you should at some point get the following equipment:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Toothguard</b> </li>
  <li> <b>BJJ/JJ/Judo/Martial art Gi/Kimono and a starter belt.</b> <br>
    You need a Gi when doing grading. for your first grading it's possible to borrow a Gi from the club.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Maybe an earprotector for grappling/wrestling.</b> 
  </li>
  <li> <b>A Rashguard</b> <br>
    Either a standard one from a random martial arts store or a custom one from <a class="extlink" href="http://cruzcmbt.com/" target="_blank"> cruzcmbt.com </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> We at NJJ recommend the Gi's: Atama - Mundial Series. It is a very good Gi for a decent price. <a class="extlink" href="http://www.atamaeurope.com/" target="_blank"> (Link to their site) </a>
