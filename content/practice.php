<h2>General Schedule</h2>
<p>We hold three instructed practices a week and one open mat session. <br>
   Tuesday trainings are focused on takedowns â€“ how to effectively take an opponent down. <br>
   Fridays are focused on striking.
</p>
<p>On Saturdays, the club has reserved an open mat, where members can come, spar together, and practice technique. No instruction is given during this day - nevertheless, it is very important to apply learned techniques and train conditioning. These trainings are held with BJJ Team Trondheim at Haakon VIIs gate 7, 7041, Trondheim. <a class="extlink" href="http://trondheim-bjj.no/kontakt/" target="_blank">(Check out their website here.)</a> </p>
<p>Sunday is reserved for grappling trainings. During this training you will get instructions on how to protect yourself and how to submit your opponent on the ground.</p>
<p>Practices start in August and we keep training until the schoolyear is over.</p>

<h2>Session overview</h2>
<p>Each training begins with about a half-hour of instructed warm up. It is mainly done through different kind of rolls, crawling and other typical warming up exercises such as running and jumping. Ju Jitsu requires a lot of flexibility, and proper warm up is crucial to protect you from any kind of injuries.</p>
<p>The warm-up is followed by about an hour of technique practice held by our instructors. The first half-hour is used for instructions of techniques; an instructor presents a technique and explains crucial details. Afterwards, the members join into pairs and practice technique for a few minutes. The instructor is following the class, observing major mistakes and answering questions. Usually we learn one or two techniques a day.</p>
<p>After instructions comes time for free sparring, where members are free to compete together. Everyone can polish the new skills they have learned, or try something completely different. This part is not obligatory, however it is necessary to develop your skills.</p>
<p>The main instruction language is English, thus we are open for both Norwegian and international students.</p>
